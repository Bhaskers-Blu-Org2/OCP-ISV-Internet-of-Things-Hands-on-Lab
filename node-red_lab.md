# Innovation-Day: Internet of Things - Node-RED Lab

[![Node-RED](http://nodered.org/node-red.png) Node RED](http://nodered.org) is an IoT platform that lets you build IoT Solutions with a graphical interface. It can be installed in any node enabled device, PC or VM.

With this step-by-step lab you will work with a Node RED instance inside an Intel Edison Board to gather telemetry from sensors, send it to the cloud, represent it and send cloud to device messages as well:

1. [Prerequisites: Install the Intel Edison Drivers](./installedison.md)
1. [Check if your Intel Edison has Node-RED installed](./node-red_lab_1.md)
1. [Work with sensors](./node-red_lab_2.md)
1. [Send data to the cloud](./node-red_lab_3.md)
1. [Visualize your data](./node-red_lab_4.md)
1. [Cloud to device messages](./node-red_lab_5.md)

## More

You can run Node-RED in many platforms, including Azure in a VM: https://nodered.org/docs/platforms/azure or even better in a [Web App](https://github.com/jmservera/node-red-azure-webapp) clicking this button...
