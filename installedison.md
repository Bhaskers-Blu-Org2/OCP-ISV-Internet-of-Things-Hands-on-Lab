# Innovation-Day: Internet of Things - Install Edison

You will need:

* A ssh client (like [putty](http://www.putty.org/))
* The Intel&reg; Edison Drivers: https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/hardware/edison/downloads

## Drivers Configuration

During the drivers configuration you will be able to change the board name and the password for the *root* user.

> If your event host has already set a password for you, ask before changing it :smiley:

You have a full step by step installation guide here: https://software.intel.com/en-us/installing-drivers-for-intel-edison-board-with-windows

## Connecting to your Edison Board

Once installed you will have something like this in your device manager, with several Serial Ports, the two Intel Edison ports are for debugging, but there is a *USB Serial Port(COMXX)*:

![ports](./images/ports.png "Serial Ports")

The red mark indicates the COM port you will need to setup in your ssh client, take a look on which port you have in your computer and use it as the port in the putty configuration:

Once you have connected through serial with the COM port at 115200 bauds with putty, you will be asked for credentials (you may have to press the enter key to get a message):

The default user is **root** and the password is the one you did set during the setup. (*Note: in our labs, we usually set IntelEdison as default password for all the boards*)

## WiFi Configuration

If you didn't configure your WiFi during the first setup, you still can configure it from your board using the command:

``` 
    configure_edison --wifi
``` 

Where you will get a list of available WiFi networks to connect:

## Start the Lab

The next steps depend on each lab, just go to the [Labs page](./README.md) and start the lab you were following:
1. **Easy**: [Node-Red](node-red_lab.md) will help you setting up a visual environment in your device and start creating a full IoT solution with very few code or even no code at all.
1. **Medium**: [Thing Labs](http://thinglabs.io/labs/edison/) is a step by step lab with an Intel Edison board, programming in Node.js and connecting it to IoT Hub. Requires basic JavaScript and Node.js knowledge.
1. **Expert**: [Connect The Dots](http://connectthedots.io) is a full featured lab that takes at least a full day and provides an end to end solution with devices, IoT services, Stream Analytics, Machine Learning and PowerBI.
