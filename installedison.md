# Innovation-Day: Internet of Things - Install Edison

But first of all you will need to install your Intel Edison Board. You will need:

* A ssh client (like [putty](http://www.putty.org/))
* The Intel Edison Drivers: [https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/hardware/edison/downloads]

Once installed you will have something like this in your device manager:

![ports](./images/ports.png)

The red mark indicates the COM port you will need to setup in your ssh client:

![putty](./images/serial.png)

Once you have connected through serial with the COM port at 115200 bauds, you will get a screen like this (you may have to press the enter key to get a message):

![login](./images/edisonlogin.png)

The next steps depend on each lab, just go to the [Lab page](./README.md) and start.
